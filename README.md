My experience spans across C#, .NET, Python, Flask, and FastAPI, with a focus on REST APIs, Microservices, and Data Analysis using ElasticSearch, Kibana, and Kafka. I have a strong foundation in both traditional and modern back-end technologies, paired with a curiosity for cloud computing and distributed systems.

Key Technologies I Work With:

Backend Development: .NET, C#, Python, Flask, FastAPI
Data & Analytics: ElasticSearch, Kibana, SQL, MongoDB, SQLite
