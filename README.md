## Hi there! I'm Ryan! 👋

💻 Backend Developer & Data Analyst | Data Science Student

I'm a versatile Backend Developer and Data Analyst with nearly a year of experience building efficient, scalable systems and analyzing data to provide actionable insights. My dual focus allows me to create strong backend infrastructures while leveraging data for business intelligence.

Currently pursuing a degree in Data Science at FIAP, I’m honing my skills in analytics, big data, and BI tools like Power BI. I’m experienced in managing databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB and use ElasticSearch and Kibana to transform raw data into valuable information.

Core Skills:
Backend Development: .NET, C#, Python, Flask, FastAPI
Data & BI: Power BI, ElasticSearch, Kibana, PostgreSQL, SQL, MongoDB, SQLite
DevOps & Infrastructure: Docker, Linux, CLI, Git/GitHub, GitLab
APIs & Microservices: REST, Kafka, JSON, Swagger

🌐 Fluent in English and Portuguese, I thrive in diverse teams and am always open to new challenges in IT, BI, and data analysis. Let’s connect if you’re looking for a developer with a data-driven mindset and a passion for continuous learning!🚀
